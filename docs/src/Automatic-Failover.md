This page explains how to configure asynq to take advantage of [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) to avoid downtime due to Redis failure.

### Prerequisite 

Please read the doc on [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) to understand the topic.

### Configuring Asynq to use Redis Sentinels

Configuring `asynq`'s `Client` and `Server` to use Redis Sentinel is simple. 
Use `RedisFailoverClientOpt` to speicfy the name of your Redis master and addresses of your Redis Sentinels.

```go
var redis = &asynq.RedisFailoverClientOpt{
    MasterName:    "mymaster",
    SentinelAddrs: []string{"localhost:5000", "localhost:5001", "localhost:5002"},
}
```

And pass this client option to `NewClient` and `NewBackground` to create an instance that uses Redis Sentinels.

```go
client := asynq.NewClient(redis)

// ...

srv := asynq.NewServer(redis, asynq.Config{ Concurrency: 10 })
```

With this setup, when your Redis master goes down, Sentinels will start a failover process and `asynq` will be notified of the new master and background task processing will continue to work üëç.
